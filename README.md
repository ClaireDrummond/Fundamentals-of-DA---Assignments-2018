# Fundamentals of Data Analysis Assignments-2018
An Investigation into Anscombe's quartet dataset. 

I was tasked with researching the Anscombe Quartet dataset.  Analysing the summary statistics and plotting the data on to graphs.  

The key finding from this exercise was The Anscombe Quartet clearly shows the importance of data visualisation.  PLease review the Jupyter Notebook for full investigation

# How to Run the Jupyter Notebook

Working with Jupyter Notebook files on GitHub: When you add Jupyter Notebook or IPython Notebook files with a .ipynb extension on GitHub, they will render as static HTML files in your repository. The interactive features of the notebook, such as custom JavaScript plots, will not work in your repository on GitHub. To view your Jupyter notebook with JavaScript content rendered or to share your notebook files with others you can use nbviewer. For an example, see Linking and Interactions.ipynb rendered on nbviewer.

To view a fully interactive version of your Jupyter Notebook, you can set up a notebook server locally. Jupyter's official documentation. https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html

After you have installed the Jupyter Notebook on your computer, you are ready to run the notebook server. You can start the notebook server from the command line (using Terminal on Mac/Linux, Command Prompt on Windows) by running:

'jupyter notebook'

This will print some information about the notebook server in your terminal, including the URL of the web application

When the notebook opens in your browser, you will see the Notebook Dashboard, which will show a list of the notebooks, files, and subdirectories in the directory where the notebook server was started. Most of the time, you will wish to start a notebook server in the highest level directory containing notebooks. Often this will be your home directory.
